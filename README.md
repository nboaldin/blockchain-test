This implementation uses the `sha2` crate to generate SHA-256 hashes for each block in the blockchain. The blockchain itself is stored as a vector of blocks, and the token holder information is stored in a `HashMap` where the keys are the holders' names and the values are their token balances.

The `issue_tokens` method adds a specified number of tokens to a given holder's balance, and the `transfer_tokens` method transfers a specified number of tokens from one holder to another. The `get_token_balance` method retrieves the token balance of a given holder.

Note that this is just one example of how you could implement a blockchain in Rust where the tokens are backed by precious metals. There are many other ways to design and implement a blockchain, and the specific design and implementation details will depend on the requirements and use case for your particular blockchain.
